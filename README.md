# CSE185_Proj: t-sKNEE

This is a package that implements tsne analysis and plotting as a CSE185 project. The main tsne calculation function `tsKNEE` takes in an anndata object and outputs a n_obs x 2 matrix that contains the x and y coordinates for plotting for each sample. The tsne plotting function `tsKNEE_plot` takes an anndata obects and generate the tsne plot. 

t-sKNEE implements a subset of functions of `scanpy.tl.tsne` and `sc.pl.tsne`. For more information about these functions visit ![scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/tools.html) page.

## Installation

The user needs to have the following libraries installed: `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`. This line of code can be run in command line for for installing these packages.

```
pip install matplolib numpy
```
Once the required libraries are installed, you can install `t_sKNEE` witht the following command.
```python setup.py install```

## Basic usage

There are two functions you can run for `tsKNEE` and `tsKNEE_plot`. The only required parameters to both functions is an anndata object. See Data Processing section for more information on the anndata object.

The basic usage of `tsKNEE` is: 
```
coor = tsKNEE(adata, T=1000, perp = 30)
```
- `T=1000`: the number of iterations tsKNEE go through to try and plot samples with similar similarity matrix
- `perp=30`: the perplexity 

The basic usage of `tsKNEE_plot` is: 
```
tsKNEE_plot(adata, coor = None, perp = 30, xlabel = "tsne1", ylabel = "tsne 2", title = "", save = None)
```

- `coor = None`: a n_obs x 2 matrix for plotting. If none, will run `tsKNEE` in the function with `adata `. 
- `perp = 30`: the perplexity to run `tsKNEE` if necessary
- `xlabel = "tsne1"`: the x-axis label for the graph
- `ylabel = "tsne 2"`: the y-axis label for the graph
- `title = ""`: the graph title
- `save = None`: to save graph in a file

To run `tsKNEE` and `tsKNEE_plot` on a small test example run `test_t-sKNEE.py`

## Data preprocessing

The input adata object needs to be **Leiden clustered** in both `t-sKNEE` and `tsKNEE_plot`. The anndata object needs to have a column named `'leiden'` in `anndata.obs` dataframe storing the cluster information for the sample. 

The desired quality control should be done previous to using t-sKNEE.
